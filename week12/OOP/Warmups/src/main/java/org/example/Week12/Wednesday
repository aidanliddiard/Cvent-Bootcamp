    Inheritance - the act of using abstraction
    Polymorphism - see above
    Encapsulation - confine what is seen or hide

What is inheritance in Java, and how does it promote code reuse?
    You can create parent classes that you can reuse in child classes. Sharable fields.

Provide an example of a class that implements an interface.
