GROUP DISCUSSION

I'd like you to do some research on the design pattern called "Model-View-Controller" or MVC for short.
You can search for it on Google or use ChatGPT or any resource that has the info, it won't be hard to find.

Please answer the following questions:

1. Define MVC in your own words.
MVC is a way of organizing code so that files are organized by function.

2. Define what the Model, View, and Controller are each responsible for.
Model is the information manager, the data structure, DATA
View is the what the user sees, the interface that displays information, SEE
Controller is what the user uses to convert user input or events into actions, MIDDLE

3. How do the Model, View, and Controller interact?
The user sees the view and uses the controller which manipulates the model and the model updates the view.

4. What are some MVC frameworks? You can find frameworks that are not in Java.
Ruby on Rails, Django, Node (you can), Spring, .NET

5. Why do you think developers use MVC?
It splits responsibilities by function. Predictable code is easier to change.
